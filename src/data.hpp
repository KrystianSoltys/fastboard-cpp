"C++ is a general-purpose programming language\n\
created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup\n\
as an extension of the C programming language, or \"C with Classes\"\n\
The language has expanded significantly over time,\n\
and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic,\n\
and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation\n\
It is almost always implemented as a compiled language,\n\
and many vendors provide C++ compilers.\n",

"Bjarne Stroustrup (born 30 December 1950)\n\
is a Danish computer scientist, most notable for\n\
the invention and development of the C++ programming language.\n\
(thanks a lot..)\n\
As of July 2022, Stroustrup is a Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University.\n\
Stroustrup is best known for his work on C++.\n\
In 1979, he began developing C++ (initially called \"C with Classes\").\n\
In his own words, he \"invented C++, wrote its early definitions,\n\
and produced its first implementation.\n"
